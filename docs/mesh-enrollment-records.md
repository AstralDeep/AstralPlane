# Mesh membership, enrollment, and revocation records

This repository slice exposes the durable identity/challenge state required by owner-confirmed
personal-mesh enrollment. It stores only neutral records: possession proof, IAM, QR/network
handling, and admission policy stay with the host, and private device keys never reach
AstralPlane. The current Plane schema is `089.002`; the slice's tables arrive in the `089.002`
edge over six additive tables.

## Public composition

`create_mesh_enrollment_repository()` returns a stateless `MeshEnrollmentRepository`, also
available as `runtime.repositories.mesh_enrollment`. Every method takes a caller-owned Plane
transaction and never commits, borrows a connection, or runs product callbacks, so Deep can
compose ownership, audit, outbox, and authority writes into one atomic unit.

## Records

- `mesh_record`: one owner's mesh with a bounded display name, monotonic `membership_epoch` and
  `revocation_epoch` counters, and a `record_version` compare-and-set fence.
- `mesh_member`: a `device`, `agent`, or `companion` member with the membership epoch it was
  activated at, an `active`/`revoked`/`retired` status, and its own `record_version` fence.
- `mesh_public_identity`: public key material, algorithm, and a 64-hex fingerprint for one
  member. Binding requires a locked, active member row. Private keys stay at their device.
- `mesh_enrollment_challenge`: an opaque 64-hex possession-challenge digest with host-supplied
  BIGINT issue/expiry windows and a `pending`/`proven`/`expired`/`cancelled` state machine.
- `mesh_enrollment_invitation`: an opaque 64-hex invitation digest with a
  `pending`/`consumed`/`confirmed`/`expired`/`revoked` state machine and the same windows.
- `mesh_member_revocation`: one revocation per member per revocation epoch with a bounded reason.

## Isolation and concurrency

- Every ordinary read and write is scoped to the calling owner in the SQL predicate itself.
- Activation and revocation require the caller's `expected_mesh_version` and
  `expected_member_version`; activation uses member version `0` only for create-only intent.
  Existing members need their exact current version, including intentional re-enrollment after
  retirement or revocation. Confirmation also requires `expected_invitation_version` and the
  host's `as_of` within the invitation window. Stale authority cannot reactivate a member.
- Compound transitions take the mesh lock first and use a local savepoint, so caught conflicts
  preserve the caller's other writes without consuming an epoch or partially confirming.
- Epoch counters are allocated with `UPDATE mesh_record ... RETURNING` inside the caller's
  transaction. Concurrent writes observing the same revision admit one winner; losers refresh
  current records before a new host decision. Accepted writes receive distinct monotonic epochs.
- Invitation consumption and expiry use fenced state transitions; confirmation additionally
  validates current mesh/member/invitation versions and the issue/expiry window; exactly one concurrent consumer or confirmer wins and every loser receives
  a typed conflict (`mesh_invitation_expired`, `mesh_invitation_digest_mismatch`,
  `repository_conflict`) instead of silent success.
- `bootstrap_mesh` creates the mesh and its first member atomically and replays idempotently;
  concurrent exact replays return the first member without advancing epochs. An existing mesh
  cannot gain another bootstrap member; later enrollment uses explicit current-revision fences.
- Transition fences (`record_version`, state predicates) raise typed conflicts on stale writes.

## Compatibility behavior

The slice is purely additive over the `089.001` catalog: no existing table, column, or function
changes, and no edge in this slice uses `IF NOT EXISTS`. The owner/version repair changes only
this unmerged repository API: its guarded DDL, schema revision, migration digest, and component
pins stay unchanged. An older Plane binary cannot run against the newer schema. Recovery uses
a qualified forward repair or the coordinated PostgreSQL/blob restore in the `089.002` section
of [migration and recovery](migration-and-recovery.md), with the matching prior composition.
Epoch counters are monotonic by design and are never rewritten.
