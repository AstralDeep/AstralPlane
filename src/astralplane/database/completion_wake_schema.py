"""Additive completion-subscription and deduplicated wake-receipt tables.

A completion subscription is an owner-scoped, durable continuation request:
"wake this waiter when that source reaches a terminal condition". Wake
receipts are idempotency-keyed so registration-versus-completion races,
restarts, and replays never double-deliver. Tables are standalone (no
foreign keys into operation state) so subscriptions never smuggle data into
current wait-state JSON and survive independent lifecycle changes.
