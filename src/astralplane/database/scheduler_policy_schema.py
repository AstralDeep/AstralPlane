"""088.007 optional scheduled-job policy and occurrence-to-assignment binding.

Both tables are additive. A definition without a policy row keeps every
pre-088.007 recurrence semantic; only Deep's policy-aware admission path reads
these rows. Charges (``admitted_runs``) are never decremented and bindings are
never rewritten, so Stop and Forget keep history.
